#### Broader Impact and Inclusivity Statement
Over the past few years, people have put in an increased effort to bridge the gap in STEM between underrepresented groups and inclusivity. However, even with this increased effort there is much more that can and should be done to fill this gap. While creating our software, we kept in mind that people from different backgrounds and experience levels would access this. Therefore, we tried to add docstrings and the proper documentation in order to make this software as accessible as possible. However, we do understand that there is more work that needs to be done to make our software more accessible and user-friendly. Currently, our software is targeted towards those who are familiar with English mathematical terms and symbols. Our software is catered towards the average English speaker. Moving forward, to make our software more inclusive, we would try to make it more accessible for those who are not as familiar with the English language.

We understand that our software has both positive and negative implications. However, we believe the positive implications outweigh the negative ones. Our team has simply found one way to tackle the problem using Automatic Differentiation and believe that we are adding to the diversity of technology in the community by contributing our software. However, we do understand that there is more that can be done to make this software inclusive as mentioned before.

Furthermore, Harvard's diversity statement says, "[their] commitment to diversity in all forms is rooted in [the] fundamental belief that engaging with unfamiliar ideas, perspectives, cultures, and people creates the conditions for dramatic and meaningful growth." Our team believes that by engaging with the software we have created, we are sharing our ideas and perspectives on a certain way to solve a problem. However, we are open to suggestions and any feedback our users have. We are constantly seeking to improve the way we implemented our software.
